    <h1> My Favorite Band</h1>
    <img src="Images/elani2.jpg" alt="Elani">
    <p>Elani are a Kenyan pop group from Nairobi that consists of three members; Wambui Ngugi, Maureen Kunga and Brian Chweya. The trio of scholars met while still students at the Alliance Francaise, Nairobi and quickly becoming friends and since then their bond grew into realizing that they shared a common passion for music.</p>
    <p>Their music is quite relatable, and in a language that is easy to understand, as it's about all that happens around us and to us. The kind of music that appeals to both the younger and older generations. They won the Best African Pop award at the 2014 All Africa Music Awards ceremony. It initially started with five members but two of them left and the three decided to forge on.</p>

      <p>Brian Chweya is the last member of the trio that make up Elani. The guitarist and only male vocalist is the man behind the group. He has a mellow voice and admits to loving his mom with a passion, loves music and is always there to spread good vibes. He is a lawyer by profession and a member of the Kenyan Bar of Advocates.
         While attending Upper Hill School, he joined music club because of the 'funkies' school functions because every week the music club was always out of the school and the fun part was they were mostly visiting girls' school. On finally realising that he had a knack for singing, he decided to start his own group and after being introduced by friends to Wambui and Maureen, the band was formed.</p>
