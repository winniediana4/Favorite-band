    <p>Elani are a Kenyan pop group from Nairobi that consists of three members; Wambui Ngugi, Maureen Kunga and Brian Chweya. The trio of scholars met while still students at the Alliance Francaise, Nairobi and quickly becoming friends and since then their bond grew into realizing that they shared a common passion for music.</p>
    <p>Their music is quite relatable, and in a language that is easy to understand, as it's about all that happens around us and to us. The kind of music that appeals to both the younger and older generations. They won the Best African Pop award at the 2014 All Africa Music Awards ceremony.</p>
